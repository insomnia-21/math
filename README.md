## Get started building your personal website
### Showcase your software development skills

This repository gives you the code you'll need to kickstart a personal website that showcases your work as a software developer. And when you manage the code in a GitHub repository, it will automatically render a webpage with the owner's profile information, including a photo, bio, and repositories.

Your personal website is waiting to be personalized, though. It includes space to highlight your specific areas of interest in software development, like languages or industries. And it's standing by to publish your next great blog post.

It's all possible using the combination of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) (for building your website), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (for hosting your website), and [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (for automatically populating your website with content).

## Features

* Showcase your work through a pick of your GitHub repos, complete with metadata
* Let people know if you're available to hire, as well as your key skills and interests
* Dark mode option!
* Write blog posts and extra pages with ease, using Markdown
* Link to all of your social media accounts

... and more! The theme is fully customizable, and many more features and fixes are planned.
